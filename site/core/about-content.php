		<h1>About</h1>
		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Welcome to <b>Kokomo</b>. Kokomo was created to capture the awesome feeling you have when 
			being on vacation, and letting it become a part of the prior decision making part as well. </p>
		<h2>Our manifest</h2>
		<p>We felt planning new experiences should be more than just typing dates and 
			destination into a search browser. We are trying to add colour to the process that
			comes before arrival.<br><br>Even though postcards and travel catalogues are a relic
		 	of the past, we are trying to utilize some of these old virtues and put them in new 
		 	forms. With the boom of social media, inspiration and sharing should be a more integral
		 	part of planning your future treasured moments.<br><br>
		 	We hope you will like it here, and entrust us to be a guidance provider when you are
		 	looking to have the time of your life.<br><br>
		 	In short:
			 	<ul>
			 		<li>By sharing more of the world, you get to see more of the world.</li>
			 		<li>New features can radically improve decision-making when browsing destinations.</li>
			 		<li>Choosing a destination should be more sociable and easy-to-share. </li>
			 		<li>Social media enables new ways of to inspire, share and help others.</li>
			 		<li>Review comments and images should be more reliable and tied to real people.</li>
			 	</ul>
			 	<br><br>
		 	Any thoughs are more than welcome. The feedback button is only a click away.</p>
