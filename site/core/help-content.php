				<b>Q:</b><i> How do I manage my bookings?</i><br><br>
				<b>A:</b> To see, change, cancel or similar requests, we refer to the provider
				where you booked the accomodation. <br><br>
				<b>Q:</b><i> How do I contact you?</i><br><br>
				<b>A:</b> Simple: go to the <a href="<?php echo BASE_URL?>contact/contact.php"target="_blank"><b>contact page</b> 
					or send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:contact@kokomoholiday.com"><b>help@kokomoholiday.com</b></a> and we'll
